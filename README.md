One session lasts 5 minutes.

It is recommended to do 3 sessions a day ideally, but just do what you can.

## Installation

Just clone the repository locally to your computer with the git clone command.

## Usage

With an up-to-date browser, it seems you need a local webserver to make it run. 
If you don't, the app might not work (Cross-Origin Request problems).

Just launch the index.html, click on the START button and the application will guide you through the session.
